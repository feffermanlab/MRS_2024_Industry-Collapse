## How an Industry Collapse Affects Community Mental Health: a Complex Contagion Model
The goal of this code is to simulate the collapse of a fish population and how fishermen transition through different stress classes through simple and complex contagion processes. Figures are created to show the transitions through time.

## Code Description
Note that across files, alpha, phi, c, and some others are defined seperately in each file. They must match across files to get outputs that correspond. Be on the lookout for this.
